                    The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) is a large predatory shark found in coastal waters worldwide,
                    including rivers and estuaries, making it one of the few shark species capable of surviving in
                    freshwater. Named for its stocky build and aggressive nature, bull sharks are known for their
                    ability to tolerate a wide range of salinities and can venture far upstream into rivers. They are
                    opportunistic feeders, preying on fish, dolphins, turtles, and even other sharks. Bull sharks are
                    often implicated in shark attacks on humans due to their proximity to shorelines and their
                    territorial behavior. Their adaptability and resilience make them a formidable predator in both
                    marine and freshwater ecosystems.

                    The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is a large predatory fish known for its distinctive striped
                    pattern that resembles a tiger's stripes, hence its name. It inhabits tropical and temperate waters
                    around the world and is recognized for its voracious appetite and opportunistic feeding behavior.
                    Tiger sharks have powerful jaws and serrated teeth, enabling them to consume a wide variety of prey,
                    including fish, seabirds, turtles, seals, and even other sharks. They are considered apex predators
                    but face threats from habitat destruction, overfishing, and accidental capture in fishing gear.
                    Tiger sharks play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems.

                    The hammerhead shark is a distinct species known for its uniquely shaped head, which features a
                    wide, flattened structure resembling a hammer. These sharks are found in oceans worldwide, often
                    inhabiting coastal areas and deeper waters. Their hammer-shaped heads provide them with exceptional
                    sensory capabilities, including improved vision and the ability to detect prey more efficiently.
                    As skilled predators, hammerhead sharks primarily feed on fish, squid, and crustaceans, utilizing
                    their specialized head to locate and capture prey effectively.

                    The whale shark is the largest fish species on Earth, known for its enormous size and gentle nature.
                    Despite its name, it is a shark rather than a whale and belongs to the family Rhincodontidae. These
                    magnificent creatures can grow up to lengths exceeding 12 meters (40 feet) and are found in tropical
                    and warm temperate oceans around the world.

                    Characterized by their distinctive spotted patterning and wide, flattened heads, whale sharks are
                    filter feeders, primarily consuming plankton, small fish, and other microscopic organisms. They swim
                    with their mouths open, filtering large volumes of water to extract their food.
